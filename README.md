Project
This project was part of [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com). As a group of 4 we developed the idea together and put our ideas into code. For all four of us this was the first 2-week coding project.

The rails app was generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates).
